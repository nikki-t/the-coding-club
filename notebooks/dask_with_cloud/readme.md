# Dask for Parallelized Analysis of NASA Earthdata in the Cloud

Included here are a collection of notebooks which demonstrate Dask (Python package) for parallel computing in the cloud using AWS resources and Earth data hosted by NASA. They are meant to be both pedagogical and serve as a quick reference/refresher, but do assume some prerequisite knowledge.

## Prerequisites
* Python coding experience. A basic familiarity is required, but more experience will make working with Dask easier. Many key packages for scientific analysis (e.g. Xarray, NumPy) work with Dask only if the proper syntax is used, which will likely be familiar to those who have already worked with these packages. However, this should not deter you from jumping in!
* Ability to start a virtual machine (VM) in AWS. All notebooks here assume that you are in a VM in AWS, and will not work unless you are. Whether you start
